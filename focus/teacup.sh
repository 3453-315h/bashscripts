Create a chemical that will destroy any non water particles and leaves nothing but pure h2o. Insert the chemical into the tea cup and wait for the process to complete.
Flip the cup by lifting it from underneath until the top rests flatly on the table, allowing the contents to pour out.
Push the cup on its side and then lift it until all of the contents pour out.
Pour another liquid that is heavier into the cup until it reaches capacity and flows over, flushing the tea out of the cup.
Use a torch or hot plate to boil and evaporate all of the water.
Buy a humidifier and place an intake tube into the base of the cup. Power on the humidifier and wait untill the intake tube is no longer effective due to a lack of remaining suctionable water. Power off the humidifier and wait for evaporation to naturally occur. Wipe out the inner cup remaining tea leaves and particles with a paper towel.
Use a dehumidifier within the room where the cup of tea resides, decreasing the relative humidity and enabling the evaporation process to become more effective.
Use a flexible straw to siphon the tea out.
Take a spoon or ladel and scoop out the tea.
Take a towel or sponge and place it in the tea, allowing it to absorb.
Place the cup in a pressure cooker, allowing the tea to boil and eventually be released through steam / water vapor.
Break the cup with a hammer, allowing the tea to flow out of the cup.
Drink the tea.
Pay someone to remove the tea from the cup.
Use a high powered fan to blow the tea out of the cup, or the cup off of the surface, allowing it to flip over and pour out its contents.
Add polyethylene glycol to the tea, thoroughly mix it and tilt the cup, allowing it to begin self-pouring / siphoning the rest of the contents out.
Train an animal to consume the tea and place the animal in the room with access to the tea cup.
Wait for an earthquake or other natural disaster to occur and naturally impact the integrity of the cup, allowing for the tea to escape due to gravity.
Use a laser to pierce a hole in the cup, allowing the tea to flow out.
Mount the tea cup to a stable surface and use a device to artifically flip the gravity within a region of space where the tea resides, allowing it to escape.
Place a significant amount of dessicant material into the cup, allowing the tea to become absorbed. Remove the dessicant material and thusly, the tea.
Question the possibility of a multiverse and imagine an existence where the tea does not exist within the cup. Use a device to interact with this universe and modify the existence of the cups contents within this reality.
Use Heisenberg's uncertainty principle to perform a measurement of the tea particles momentum within the cup to such a precise degree that it cannot be determined what their position is and if the tea truly resides within the cup.
Do not directly observe the cup and use SchrÃ¶dinger's cat thought experiment to theorize whether tea existed within the cup or not, potentially negating the need to remove tea from the cup.
Use a device that can target the tea particles and force them to quantum tunnel through the barrier of the cup.
Change the english language used to describe both tea and a cup to become synonymous so that removing tea from a cup is impossible as they have become known to be one and the same.
Use a time machine to go back to a state prior to the cup containing any tea. Prevent tea from ever entering the cup.
Replace the cup of tea with a cup not containing tea and lie about ever doing it.
Place the cup of tea upside-down on a flat, air-tight surface and place it into a freezer. Tap the cup until the frozen contents separate from the cup and lift the cup off of the frozen tea.
