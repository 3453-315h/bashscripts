# Bash scripts
This repository is a collection of bashscripts that [@routeback] has developed or is in the process of developing. These have been tested on Kali linux and Mac OSX with terminator and iTerm, respectively. Most of these scripts are for a single specific use and meant to be added to the local $PATH for convenience.

### Version
0.1

### Installation
Simply run the scripts from a bash shell:
```sh
$ source append.sh
```

Specify the path to them in your startup script or bash profile for more convenient usage
```sh
$ git clone [git-repo-url]
$ cd bashscripts
$ echo "PATH=~/github/routeback/bashscripts:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Todos
 - Upload additional scripts
