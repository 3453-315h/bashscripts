Since version 0.50, binwalk has a -e option to extract files. Unfortunately, the manual doesn't tell you this, but if you invoke binwalk -version, it tells you

-e, --extract=[file]          Automatically extract known file types. Load rules from file, if specified.
Of course, you can use dd as well. For example, if you want the executable at 68264, calculate its size first (105904-68264=37640), then:

$ dd if=myfile.bin of=executable.so bs=1 skip=68264 count=37640
