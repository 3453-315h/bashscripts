To find author:

Make the decision that makes a thousand
We don’t see the world as it is, but as we are
Plan the work and work the plan
What should be done eventually should probably be done immediately
The only lies we are truly punished for are the ones we tell ourselves
Success isn’t for everyone
If you don’t prioritize your life, someone else will
There are no bad teams, just bad Leaders 
Growth and comfort cannot coexist
Care enough to be candid
Challenges make us bitter or better
Pressure is a privilege
The more you know the less you use
